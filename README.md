# Dirty-Cafe-Sales-10-000-Rows-MySQL-Data-Cleaning-to-Power-BI-Dashboard
This in-progress project uses the “Dirty Cafe Sales” dataset from Kaggle (10 000 rows of café transactions with missing values, inconsistent formats, typos, and duplicates). The goal is to clean and validate the data with SQL in MySQL Workbench and then build a Power BI dashboard.
