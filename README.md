This completed project uses the “Dirty Cafe Sales” dataset from Kaggle, which contains 10,000 rows of café transactions with missing values, inconsistent formats, typos, and duplicates. The data was cleaned and validated using SQL in MySQL Workbench through column renaming, whitespace trimming, type handling, and duplicate detection with window functions. The cleaned dataset was then used to conduct exploratory analysis and develop a Power BI dashboard with KPIs, item performance metrics, bulk order insights, and sales patterns by category, time, and payment method.
